This is POC of CVE-2012-6066

freeSSHd.exe in freeSSHd through 1.2.6 allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via a crafted session, as demonstrated by an OpenSSH client with modified versions of ssh.c and sshconnect2.c.

This repo contains the crafted ssh.c and ssheconnect2.c files.
Diff.txt file specifies information about the crafted files. 

In this POC only password based authentication is exploited. 
Download the openssh5.8p2 source code and replace ssh.c,sshconnect2.c with the modified files and recompile the source.
